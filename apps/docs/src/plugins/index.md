# First party plugins

Zoram comes with a set of first party plugins that you can add to your
application as you need them. The ecosystem is still burgeoning so there's not
many yet (understand only one for now) but the aim is to have plugins for most
common patterns or integrations for well known libraries or frameworks when such
a thing makes sense.

## Contribute

You have an idea for a plugin ? Would like to contribute to a cool open source
project ? Feel free to open an issue so we can see how best to make it happen.
Check existing issue and add your own on [the GitHub repo](
