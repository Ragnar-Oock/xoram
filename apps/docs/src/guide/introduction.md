# What is xoram ?

xoram is a light weight javascript framework for building modular applications
for both front end and backend alike. It provides you with simple tools to
manage complexity in your application and help you write reusable and low
maintenance code so you don't have to refactor the whole app every 4 years.

## Key features

- **plugin dependency management** : plugins can depend on one another to build
  complex applications from atomic foundations
- **progressive** : you can incorporate xoram's tools one at a time or not at
  all depending on your use case
- **facilitate healthy code practices** : makes it easier to reuse code,
  decouple code that should be and prevent scope creep
